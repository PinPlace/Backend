current issue with save locations of media. Currentl places them in the base directory vs the media folder, hence the default.png is located there for now to show that it at least renders correctly

Added a charfield for the passwords but needs to be hashed

changed media from icons to media in settings, works with icons not with media. Not sure where the icons folder is??

Do we want to remove pin id from the List model?
When we click on a list its originally blank, have an add pins button there?
Then when we click on the details page we have an add pins button that pulls in the pin ids to be selected from?
